### Division
Divison by 2 or 2's exponent can be expressed in right shift ">>".  
ie. 6 / 2  === 6 >> 1  
cuz (in binary) 6 is 110 and 110 right shift one bit becomes 11 and 11 in decimal is 3.  
ie. 16 / 4 === 16 >> 2  which is 10000 >> 2 = 100  
Note: when using bit operation to do calculation, writing comments will be good cuz bit operation is not easily readable.  
```int i = 16 >> 2 // divide by 4 ```
