# The transformation between 2-dimensional aray and 1-dimensional array

Disregard whether the combined one-D dimensional array is still strictly increasing, the following foluma can be used for any 2D, 1D array transformation. 


```m```: the number of rows in 2D arrray;  
```n```: the number of columns in 2D array;  
```m * n```: the full length of the combined 1D array;  
```index```: a number's index in the 1D array, starting from 0;  
```row```: the row index of a number in 2D array, starting from 0;  
```col```: the col index of a number in 2D array, starting from 0.  

### 2D to 1D transformation
```index = row * n + col % n```

### 1D to 2D transformation
```row = index / n```  
```col = index % n```
