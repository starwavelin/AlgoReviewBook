# Static Variable vs. Instance Variable

**Static Variables**: Static variables are also known as Class variables.  

- Declared similarly as instance variables, the difference is that static variables are declared using the **static** keyword within a class outside any method constructor or block.  

- Unlike instance variables, we can only have one copy of a static variable per class irrespective of how many objects we create.  

- Static variables are created at the start of program execution and destroyed automatically when execution ends.
