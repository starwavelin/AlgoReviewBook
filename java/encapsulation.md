# Encapsulation

Encapsulation means using a protective shield to wrap data so that data cannot be accessed outside of the shield. And the shield is usually a class.  
Encapsulation can be achieved thru: declaring variables private and write public methods to get and set them.

### Advantages of Encapsulation
* Data Hiding: The user will have no idea about the inner implementation of the class. It will not be visible to the user that how the class is storing values in the variables. He only knows that we are passing the values to a setter method and variables are getting initialized with that value.

* Increased Flexibility: We can make the variables of the class as read-only or write-only depending on our requirement. ie. omitting set methods or get methods.

* Reusability: Encapsulation also improves the re-usability and easy to change with new requirements.

* Testing code is easy: Encapsulated code is easy to test for unit testing.
